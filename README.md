# Malformed Nested List in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in HTML: improperly nested unordered lists.  While visually the error may be subtle, it leads to semantic inconsistencies that can cause problems with screen readers, SEO, and overall website accessibility.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The difference highlights the importance of properly closing all HTML tags.
